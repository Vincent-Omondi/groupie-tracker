   ```

4. **Containerization with Docker (Optional):**
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running.
   - Build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t groupie-tracker .
     ```
   - Run the Docker container:
     ```bash
     docker run -p 8080:8080 groupie-tracker
     ```

## Implementation

The application is structured into several packages:

- `api`: handles API requests and data fetching.
- `controllers`: contains the routing logic and serves HTTP handlers.
- `templates`: holds HTML templates for rendering pages.
- `handlers`: processes requests and renders the appropriate responses.

Key features include:

- Error handling for better user experience.
- Dynamic filtering of artists based on search queries.

## Usage Example

Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:8080/` to view the list of artists. You can view details of a single artist by clicking on their image or navigating to `/artist/{id}`, replacing `{id}` with the artistâ€™s ID e.g `http://localhost:8080/artist/18`.
